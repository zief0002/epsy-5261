	abstract = {Continuous assessment is part and parcel of instructional process that has to be taken as a key tool in educational quality assurance endeavor. Thus, this article examined the actual practice of continuous assessment in primary schools of Chagni City Administration, Ethiopia. To address this purpose the study employed descriptive survey design. The data collected from randomly selected sample of 72 primary school teachers was analyzed by using one-sample t-test. There is discrepancy between the perceived purpose of continuous assessment and its actual practice. In conclusion, the practice of continuous assessment in primary schools lacks harmony and consistency. Developing harmonized continuous assessment policy or guideline is forwarded to the government as recommendation.},

@article{Meltzer:2021,
	abstract = {Methods:  Students (grades 3--12) and parents (grades K-12) were surveyed annually, before and for 2 years after school start time changes (ES: 60 min earlier, MS: 40--60 min later; HS: 70 min later). Student sleep and daytime sleepiness were measured with school-administered student surveys and parent-proxy online surveys.
Results:  Approximately 28,000 students annually completed surveys ({\textasciitilde}55\% White, {\textasciitilde}21\% free/reduced lunch [FRL]). Oneyear post-change, weekday bedtimes and wake times were slightly earlier for ES students, with an 11-min decrease in sleep duration. MS and HS students reported slightly later weekday bedtimes, significantly later wake times, and significantly longer sleep duration (MS: 29 min; HS: 45 min). The percent of ES students reporting sufficient sleep duration, poor sleep quality, or daytime sleepiness did not change, but the percent of MS and HS students reporting sufficient sleep duration significantly increased and clinically significant daytime sleepiness decreased. All results were maintained at the 2-year follow-up. Benefits of later start times were similar across racial and free/reduced lunch groups.
Conclusions:  This is the first large scale, longitudinal, and representative study to concurrently examine the impact of changing school start times across students in primary/secondary school. Findings suggest a minimal impact of earlier start times on ES students' sleep or daytime sleepiness, while further supporting the significant benefits of delaying MS and HS start times on student sleep and daytime sleepiness.},
