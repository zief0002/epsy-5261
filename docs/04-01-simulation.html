<p>This chapter will introduce ideas of statistical uncertainty and how we can model that uncertainty using simulation.</p>
<p><br></p>
<section id="statistical-uncertainty" class="level2" data-number="5.1">
<h2 data-number="5.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="statistical-uncertainty"><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Statistical Uncertainty</h2>
<p>What if we want to determine whether the average number of credits taken by graduate students at the University of Minnesota (UMN) in their first semester is more than 6 credits (full-time status). In order to answer this question, we collect data on the number of credits taken in the first semester from 10 UMN graduate students. Computing the sample mean, we find that the average number of credits taken for these 10 students was 7.3. Based on this evidence, you might mistakenly think that we can conclude that the average number of credits taken by graduate students at the University of Minnesota in their first year IS more than 6 credits.</p>
<p>The issue with using the sample mean to drawing a conclusion about the mean number of credits taken by the larger population of UMN graduate students is that the sample is an incomplete picture of the larger population. This means that any estimate we obtain from the sample needs to account for this incompleteness or <em>uncertainty</em>.</p>
<p>In drawing inferences about the population from sample data one thing we have to do is try and quantify the amount of uncertainty in the sample estimate. This quantification has a direct influence on the answer to our question. For example, if we could say that the uncertainty in the sample mean estimate of 7.3 was within 0.6 of a credit, this would mean that we think the average number of credits taken in the first semester by all UMN graduate students is between 6.7 and 7.9. After accounting for the uncertainty, we can infer that the average number of credits taken in the first semester by all UMN graduate students IS likely more than 6 credits. If however, we found the uncertainty in the estimate was 1.4, then our estimate for the average number of credits taken in the first semester by all UMN graduate students is between 5.9 and 8.7. In this case, we would not be able to say that the average number of credits taken in the first semester by all UMN graduate students is more than 6 credits—it might be less.</p>
<div class="fyi">
<p>If you have data for the entire population you want to draw conclusions about, then you have a complete picture and there is no uncertainty in the numerical summary you compute for this population.</p>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<section id="sources-of-uncertainty" class="level3" data-number="5.1.1">
<h3 data-number="5.1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sources-of-uncertainty"><span class="header-section-number">5.1.1</span> Sources of Uncertainty</h3>
<p>Why does incomplete data lead to uncertainty? It turns out, there are several sources of uncertainty, the most common of which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sampling variation (a.k.a, sampling error); and</li>
<li>Measurement variation (a.k.a., measurement error)</li>
</ul>
<p>Sampling variation is the idea that different samples that can be drawn from the same population produce different estimates.</p>
<p>For example, what if if we had drawn a different sample of 10 UMN graduate students. The number of credits that those students took in their first semester would likely be different than our original 10 students, which means that their average would also be different than the original average of 7.3. That is, the uncertainty in the estimate is a function of the <em>random nature of the sampling</em>.</p>
<p>Another source of uncertainty in estimates is imperfect measurement, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_error">measurement error</a>. This arises most often when the constructs we are measuring can not be directly observed (i.e., they are latent) and we have to use proxies of these construct in our analysis. For example, a researcher may be interested in studying depression in teenagers and uses the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) to get a measure of “depression” for teens in their sample. Despite having good psychometric properties (e.g., reliability) the measure produced by the BDI are imperfect measures of depression. Further, if we compute a numerical summary, say the mean, from scores that are imperfect measures, then that mean will also be an uncertain estimate not only because of sampling error, but also because of the measurement error inherent in its computation.</p>
<p>In practice, despite these being very different sources of variation, measurement error and sampling error are often combined and treated as if all of the uncertainty was due to sampling error. This</p>
<div class="fyi">
<p>EPsy 5261, we will focus on quantifying uncertainty via estimating the sampling variation/sampling error. You can learn more about how to compute and account for measurement error in courses like <a href="https://onestop2.umn.edu/pcas/viewCatalogCourse.do?courseId=002247">EPsy 5221: Priciples of Educational and Psychological Measurment</a>.</p>

<section id="sampling-error" class="level3" data-number="5.1.2">
<h3 data-number="5.1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sampling-error"><span class="header-section-number">5.1.2</span> Sampling Error</h3>
<p>To give you a better sense of sampling error and the methods we use to quantify sampling error, consider the following scenario. Imagine the population of number of credits taken for every UMN graduate student (past, present, and future) during the first semester. There would be an infinite number of these values (i.e., credits taken), but theoretically, we could plot all of these values, compute numerical summaries such as the mean and standard deviation of these values. (The mean of this distribution is what we are trying to estimate using our sample data.)</p>
<p>The conceptual idea of estimating sampling variation is that we are going to draw a sample of 10 students and compute the mean of the sample. Then we are going to repeat this process again, and again, each time drawing 10 observations and computing the mean. <a href="#fig-thought-experiment">Figure&nbsp;<span>5.1</span></a> shows a visual depiction of this thought experiment that was carried out 1000 times.</p>

<!-- (This distribution is typically unknown in practice, but for now, let's pretend we know what that distribution is.) For our purposes, let's assume the population is normally distributed with a mean of $\mu$ and a standard deviation of $\sigma$. -->
<!-- Sample $n$ observations from that population. Based on the $n$ sampled observations, find the mean. We will call this $\hat\mu_1$ since it is an estimate for the population mean (the subscript just says it is the first sample). In all likelihood, $\hat\mu_1$ is not the exact same value as $\mu$. It varies from the population mean because of sampling error. -->
<!-- Now, sample another $n$ observations from the population. Again, find the mean. We will call this estimate $\hat\mu_2$. Again, it probably varies from $\mu$, and may be different than $\hat\mu_1$ as well. Continue to repeat this process: randomly sample $n$ observations from the population; and find the mean. -->

<p>To illustrate how we can summarize and visualize quantitative attributes using R, we will again use the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zief0002/epsy-5261/main/data/college-scorecard.csv">college-scorecard.csv</a> data. As a reminder, we will start by loading three libraries, <code>{tidyverse}</code>, <code>{ggformula}</code>, and <code>{mosaicCore}</code>. Then we will import the college scorecard data using the <code>read_csv()</code> function and assign the data into an object called <code>colleges</code>. Finally, we view the data to make sure it read in properly.</p>
