12755,US,"Tart cranberry acidity marks this dry, delicately structured young wine. Dusty with tannins, the mouthfeel is tight and nervous. At the core are complex layers of forest berries, cola, mushrooms, exotic baking spices and sweet cedar.

25223,US,"A big, ripe, exuberant wine, offering a mouthful of blackberry, blueberry and cherry jam and oak flavors. The wine was fermented in 100% new French barrels.

56727,US,"Awesome Cabernet from this esteemed vineyard in Oakville. Defines the modern Napa style in the perfectly ripe black currant and blackberry fruit, and the ultra-refined tannins. Hard to exaggerate the depth and length, the sheer opulence of this 100% Cab. It was aged in 80% new French oak, which adds even richer notes of wood smoke and sweet vanilla.

89996,US,"A beautiful, complex and compelling wine that shows how well Napa can perform at Sauvignon Blanc, if it really wants to. It moves to the front ranks for its dryness, crispness and elegance, while delivering plenty of delicious flavor. Pineapples, lemons and limes flood the mouth, without the slightest grassy unripeness, and with a tantalizing hint of flowers and minerals.

Not fully vital; could already be past its prime.,Reserva de Familia,83,20,Casablanca Valley,NA,NA,Chardonnay,Santa Carolina
94523,US,"This important Pinot Noir is expensive, but it is absolutely worth a search. It's not a single-vineyard wine, but a blend of various blocks from the cooler southern part of the valley. Oak, to the tune of 70% new, is very strong in char and vanilla, but way stronger is the fruit itself, which is exemplary and stunning. Raspberries, cherries and strawberries just begin to describe it, with all sorts of spice and earth complexities. Stuns with purity, complexity and sheer delicious power. Great now, and will easily develop over the next 6–8 years.",Five Sisters,97,100,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar

99269,US,"A classic example of a young, sweetly fruity and very refined Napa Cab that needs some time in the cellar. Polished and lovely, with finely ripe tannins and decadently good flavors of blackberries, black cherries, chocolate, currants and oak. The palate's enjoyment is interfered with by the astringency. Give it until 2012 to begin to come around.",Georges III,93,55,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,B Cellars

115082,Argentina,"Black Label is a step up the quality ladder for Las Moras, based in San Juan. And this wine is full and chunky on the nose, with blackberry and plum-based aromas.

It's well-oaked and solid, with tannic bite and good texture. A serious and real wine for a good price.",Broquel,88,15,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon,Trapiche
132728,US,"Rich and full bodied, this is a tremendously ripe Chardonnay that explodes with peach custard, orange popsicle, pineapple, crème brûlée and cinnamon spice flavors, leading to a long, fruity finish.",NA,88,16,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Valley of the Moon
137088,US,"Super-ripe and dry, with raisin and Port flavors wrapped into 16.5% alcohol. It's a good example of what it is, but certainly exceeds balance.",NA,82,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Wine Guerrilla
144117,Argentina,"Very big and brawny is this single-vineyard, new-to-the-market Malbec from grower Jose Blanco. Expect lots of fresh-cut cinnamon on the nose along with leather, earth and gum. Heavy but balanced, with big tannins wrapped in plenty of coconut and mint. Takes a while to grasp; it's a giant with huge fruit and some clumsiness. Better from 2007–2009. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Vina Jose Blanco,91,34,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,NA,Malbec,Trapiche
145455,US,"Fairly tannic now, with a tart, dusty bite of grape skin, and also hefty in acidity. Underneath all that are ripe currant and cassis flavors. This is an age worthy wine that should develop great complexity after 2010.",Post Vineyard,91,60,California,Diamond Mountain District,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Von Strasser
149050,Australia,"A bright pear and cinnamon nose opens this attractive, medium-weight wine. The palate shows peach and pear flavors, supported by brisk—some might say sharp—acidity, but flabby it isn't. Shows good balance and a nice long spicy finish, where the oak comes on strong.",Barrel Fermented,86,12,South Australia,South Australia,NA,Chardonnay,Wolf Blass
149659,US,"Stainless steel fermented and aged, to bring bright, acid-driven fruit to the forefront. Full-bodied and flavorful, with nicely mixed stone fruits, pineapple, green berries and lemony citrus. It sets up sharply on the palate and holds true, just waiting for some fresh shellfish.",INOX,90,17,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay,Chehalem
150046,US,"Inexpensive Cabernet can often be slightly weedy, even rubbery, with a hot feeling to it. So it is with this wine. The Mondavi folks managed to pack in as much blackberry and cassis fruit as they could, but there's really just a hint of it. The tannins are light, the acidity soft, and that's about it.",NA,82,8,California,California,California Other,Cabernet Sauvignon,Woodbridge
