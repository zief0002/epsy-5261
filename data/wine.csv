2012,Rene Mure,Signature,90,25,France,Alsace,Pinot Noir,"Very pure notes of cherry and strawberry pervade this wine. They are perfumed with a slight conifer scent that spells freshness and lifted ease. The palate has an unforced, elegant concentration. This is charming and fresh, with convincing depth, purity and a lasting, fresh finish."
3581,McCay Cellars,Bechthold Vineyard,89,39,US,California,Cinsault,"Earthy, beefy, almost metallic aromas, then beefy, tamarind-like flavors make an exotic but rustic profile for this fascinating medium-bodied wine. The texture is rather lean and a tasty sour-cherry character develops on the finish."
3748,Pata Negra,Crianza,87,10,Spain,Northern Spain,Tempranillo Blend,"Savory, slightly saucy aromas of plum, berry, tomato and leather come with a hint of oak. This is a bit choppy and tannic, with savory, roasted flavors of tomato, plum, currant and spice. A touch of saltiness and raw-oak flavor rise up on the finish."
8809,Quintet,Flanerie Vineyard,91,48,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,"Here on display are all the elegance, finesse and ultimate power possible in wines from this exceptional AVA. Tart raspberry fruit, stiff tannins and supporting acids are nuanced with citrus, herb and a light touch of vanilla. Drink this from 2020 to 2030."
12755,Williams Selyem,Rochioli Riverblock Vineyard,92,79,US,California,Pinot Noir,"Tart cranberry acidity marks this dry, delicately structured young wine. Dusty with tannins, the mouthfeel is tight and nervous. At the core are complex layers of forest berries, cola, mushrooms, exotic baking spices and sweet cedar. Give the wine at least six years in a cellar to mature—it should be flying high by 2029."
13982,Dumas Station,Estate,90,30,US,Washington,Cabernet Franc,"Exceptionally smooth for such a young wine, this deeply-fruited red blends pretty raspberry and cherry flavors with seductively-delicious milk-chocolaty barrel notes. Happily, there is enough natural acidity to keep it lively and fresh."
14826,Giribaldi,NA,92,49,Italy,Piedmont,Nebbiolo,"A fine example of a Barolo, and a marvel considering the problems of the 2002 harvest. The fruit is dark and juicy with plenty of concentration, with the added complexity of roses and pencil shavings. Nicely textured, with a medium to long finish. Imported by Global E. Selections, LLC."
15359,Collovray et Terrier,Plenitude de Bonte,90,30,France,Burgundy,Chardonnay,"“Fullness and goodness” is a rough translation of the name of this wine. It's an accurate description of its richness. There is great spice, bolstering the full fruit, showing a mineral, chalky structure along with fresh green fruits."
15529,Joullian,Estate Reserve,89,26,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,"This is very rich and complicated, with oak and lees adding creamy, smoky notes to the ripe citrus, peach and pear flavors. It seems a little candied, in the California way, but it's clean and varietally proper."
23342,Tenuta Carlina,La Togata,86,28,Italy,Tuscany,Sangiovese Grosso,"This dark Rosso opens with aromas of dark fruit and bramble, with subtle background hints of wild mushroom and cured meat. Endnotes of crushed black pepper and crushed clove bring up the rear."
25223,Terlato,Block 9,88,48,US,California,Syrah,"A big, ripe, exuberant wine, offering a mouthful of blackberry, blueberry and cherry jam and oak flavors. The wine was fermented in 100% new French barrels. It's a bit aggressive in both oak tannins and fruit, but such is the balance that 4–5 years in the cellar could make it more interesting."
25709,Parras Vinhos,Castelo do Sulco Colheita,86,9,Portugal,Lisboa,Portuguese Red,"Elegant, fresh wine, full of delicious red berry fruits, a fruit salad of red and black plums and a light touch of spice. Bright, juicy, ready to drink."
32570,Sordo,Monvigliero,88,65,Italy,Piedmont,Nebbiolo,"Aromas of black cherries marinated in spirits, menthol, leather and chopped herbs lead the nose on this brawny wine. The hefty palate shows the heat of the vintage, offering dried berries, licorice, tobacco and mocha alongside the warmth of evident alcohol and jarring tannins. Give it a few years to let the tannins soften up a bit but then drink before the fruit dries up."
32760,Cuvee Wine Cellars,NA,87,23,US,California,Chardonnay,"Oily in green apple and lime, this crowd-pleasing wine is supple and smooth, with touches of honey and vanilla, especially on the finish. With a lilting ripeness at its core, it will pair well with roasted chicken in herbs."
33217,Fontes & Phillips,La Encantada Vineyard,90,52,US,California,Pinot Noir,"Forward in jammy raspberry and cherry fruit, this Pinot's ripeness is balanced with crisp acidity. It's a flashy wine, quite typical of the vineyard, for drinking now and over the next six years."
33505,Viña Decana,Crianza,85,5,Spain,Levante,Tempranillo,"This is solid stuff for the price, with berry and pencil eraser aromas. It feels more soft than hard, with a jammy mouthfeel and grabby tannins in front of berry and plum flavors that turn medicinal."
34684,Rare,4 Grape Blend,84,10,US,California,Red Blend,"Here's a good, robust red wine. It's made in a country-style, with tobacco, cherry and spice flavors and a jagged mouthfeel. Drink it with tacos and burgers."
37063,Q,NA,87,14,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,"A good Cabernet for the price. It's made for drinking now, with ripe blackberry and cherry fruit flavors, kissed with smoky oak."
40783,Paul Jaboulet Aine,Domaine de Roure,88,63,France,Rhone Valley,Syrah,"With its soft tannins and slightly creamy texture, the open-knit 2006 Domaine de Roure is very approachable now. Vanilla and plum notes come across as slightly oaky, but hints of olive and espresso emerge on the finish. Drink now–2015."
41342,Cinnabar,Reserve Rows Amber Knolls Vineyard,89,65,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,"A 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, with a mere 25 cases produced, it's soft in minty tannins and streams of acidity. It reveals cedar and light black cherry fruit and finishes big and smoky. Age 2019–2024, the structure is definitely there."
41661,Trapiche,Broquel,87,15,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Bonarda,"Dry oak, pepper and wood resin are prominent on the bouquet, which also brings minty black fruit scents and finally a pinch of sawdust. The palate is boosted by firm acids and tannins, while the flavors of baked berry and black plum are driving. A lot of oak and bite here, but also plenty of dark fruit."
44448,Wines & Winemakers,Azul Portugal,90,10,Portugal,Dao,Portuguese Red,"Classic tannic Dão Touriga Nacional, packed with minerality, dark and dry tannins, firm and with a good juicy final character. Part of a range of wines from across the country under the name Azul Portugal."
46429,Cantine Sant'Agata,Baby,85,10,Italy,Piedmont,Barbera,"The bouquet is fragrant and pulsating with vibrant hues of raspberry, blueberry and white almond skin. Barbera d'Asti is known for its natural freshness and the integrity of its small berry flavors. This well-priced wine has both."
47253,Chateau Ponzac,Patiemment,89,25,France,Southwest France,Malbec,"Ripe, smooth and balanced, this wine shows firm tannins and a solid, chunky build. With its rich black-plum fruit and opulent texture, it will be ready to drink in 2–3 years."
48138,Navarro,Premiere Reserve,88,25,US,California,Chardonnay,"An ultrazesty, lemony Chardonnay, this has razor-sharp acidity that should mellow out when paired with the right foods, like seafood in a creamy sauce."
53148,Lava Cap,Reserve,84,30,US,California,Petite Sirah,"Lots of berry, currant, cocoa and bacon flavors in this wine, and also plenty of tannins. Good, but turns soft, hot and a little jammy-candied toward the finish."
53262,Tokara,Director's Reserve,91,44,South Africa,Stellenbosch,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A blend of 78% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Petit Verdot, 5% Merlot and 5% Malbec, this is a tight, focused selection, with excellent precision to the black plum, blackberry, dried raspberry and cassis fruit core. Well-integrated accents of leather, cigar box and pine resin add depth and complexity. The medium-weight palate is structured yet elegant, with fine-grain, lingering tannins. Drink now through 2020."
53737,Dezzani,Ronchetti,83,18,Italy,Piedmont,Barbera,Sweet aromas of ripe berry fruit and some earth tones create a slightly awkward nose that lacks balance. Those mature fruit notes come on a bit too strong and the wine ends with bitter fruit aromas. The mouthfeel is characterized by good acidity and good density.
55178,Dumas Station,NA,91,26,US,Washington,Merlot,"This Right Bank-styled blend includes 19% Cabernet Franc and 5% Petit Verdot. Despite its high (15.3%) alcohol, it's a meaty, complex wine that drinks much lighter. The berry/cherry fruit flavors are woven into a tapestry of earth, herb and spice, smooth and detailed, and the wine has a mouth-pleasing seamless quality that invites another sip, and another."
55561,Milbrandt,Traditions,90,15,US,Washington,Merlot,"From a mix of Milbrandt vineyard sites, this outstanding blend includes small amounts of Cabernet, Syrah, Malbec and Barbera. The blend was so well done that each component adds a vital piece to the whole—smooth berry and cherry fruits, spice, tobacco, licorice and smoke, folding into a lush and chocolaty finish."
56277,Jasper,Black Road,83,13,US,Iowa,White Blend,"This exotic white blend from Iowa offers aromas of orange and citrus with a minerally zip, and on the palate, is a bit on the sweet and curvy side. Not terribly inspired but still pretty, it will pair well with Asian cuisine."
56727,Alpha Omega,Beckstoffer To Kalon,97,130,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Awesome Cabernet from this esteemed vineyard in Oakville. Defines the modern Napa style in the perfectly ripe black currant and blackberry fruit, and the ultra-refined tannins. Hard to exaggerate the depth and length, the sheer opulence of this 100% Cab. It was aged in 80% new French oak, which adds even richer notes of wood smoke and sweet vanilla. Should evolve slowly through 2020, but only 75 cases were produced."
57089,Spier,Vintage Selection Shiraz-Mourvedre-Viognier,87,18,South Africa,Coastal Region,Rhône-style Red Blend,"Foliage and black pepper adds complexity to the strong raspberry, red plum and strawberry characteristics of this wine. It's straightforward but enjoyable with gentle tannins and a smoky, bacon-nuanced finish. Drink now."
60594,Robert Young,Scion,92,54,US,California,Cabernet Blend,"Robert Young's Scion has become the quintessential Alexander Valley Cab. The opposite of a big Napa Cab, it has a soft, gentle texture, with good cherry and anise flavors, and a rich gout de terroir earthiness. Not an ager, it's among the best drink-now Cabs of the vintage."
61559,JM Cellars,NA,93,32,US,Washington,Chardonnay,"All Milbrandt fruit has created a sappy, buttery and bright Washington Chardonnay. It bursts upon the palate with a beautiful mix of tropical fruits and caramel. Flavors are rich, persistent and lush. You want more long after the bottle has been drained."
63766,Bodega Catena Zapata,Nicasia Vineyard,96,123,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Malbec,"Features intoxicating pastry, blueberry, cola and coffee aromas in front of a minerally, terroir-packed palate of soft black fruit, chocolate, fine herbs and other character-aiding touches. The mouthfeel is fabulous and the finish of Swiss chocolate and integrated spice is as smooth as silk. Drink now through 2011."
63936,Rulo,NA,94,40,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,"The 2002 Cabernet Sauvignon was the only other stand-alone Cab made from Rulo. This is 100% Cabernet, and a pure expression of Red Mountain. That purity is a hallmark of Rulo; clean and expressive, with a tight focus. Dense, ripe, black fruits, black olive, earth and rock, with a kiss of spice. It's a singularity expressed beautifully, dense and smoky and earthy and tannic, long and lush and lovely."
65118,Vallformosa,Chantal Brut Rosé,85,20,Spain,Catalonia,White Blend,"Dusty cherry aromas start out full and turn more green and grassy with time. Sweet grapefruit and tang carry the palate, and the finish is a rush of acidity. Good but odd."
68821,Bodegas Roda,Roda I,91,73,Spain,Northern Spain,Tempranillo,"A sweet, ripe, jammy style for Roda I, with smooth tannins, corpulence and more than adequate minerality and power. This is not a flabby wine despite the heat of the vintage, and the lush cassis, blackberry and mocha notes come together on the back palate and finish."
70716,Chateau Landat,NA,90,16,France,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"A dense wine, with strong elements of its wood aging still prominent, and smoothing out the tannins. It has power, a dark texture and superripe almost jammy fruits. The final has mint, spice and sweet plum juice."
70770,Felton Road,NA,90,31,New Zealand,Central Otago,Riesling,"Felton Road's Riesling perfectly balances sugars and acids in a sweet, delicate style centered on limes, green apples and crushed stones. The finish is crisp and racy, leaving behind a lingering sensation of sweetness."
71908,Boudreaux Cellars,NA,91,45,US,Washington,Merlot,"This has a lovely entry that explodes with scents of toasted almond and espresso. The black cherry and sour plum flavors command your attention, with texture and balance throughout. Drink soon."
72224,Di Meo,Don Generoso,92,120,Italy,Southern Italy,Aglianico,"As its name implies, Don Generous doles out opulence and aromatic intensity, lingering long on the nose and palate. This is a smoky, masculine expression, with notes of lead pencil, slate, prune, cassis and spice. It delivers the essences of volcanic soil with dry and firm tannins at the back."
72955,Villa Erbice,Tremenel,91,65,Italy,Veneto,Red Blend,"Tremenel has an earthy fragrance of underbrush, tobacco and ripe black fruit with a whiff of spice. The palate delivers a tight core of black cherry layered with raisin, white pepper, nutmeg and cocoa backed up by bracing but refined tannins."
74431,The Farm Winery,Cardinal,90,90,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is one of the most expensive Cabernet Sauvignons ever from Paso Robles, but the truth is that it expresses a new, emerging style from that region of balance and complexity. Made from 100% Cab, it's dry, full bodied and balanced, although a little conspicuous in alcohol. The black currant flavors are powerful and delicious. Drink soon."
75117,Chateau Giscours,Barrel Sample,94,100,France,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"93–95. Barrel sample. This firm, dry wine is solidly rich and full in the mouth. With fine acidity and black currant fruit that show through the tannins, it is a wine with considerable potential."
76024,Inspire Moore,Love,86,15,US,New York,Riesling,"Hints of bergamot add a musky elegance to tropical notes of sweet melon and tangerine in this beautifully perfumed Riesling. There's a sugariness on the midpalate, but the finish is clean and brisk, with a shower of pink grapefruit acidity."
76684,Bailiwick,Borderline,89,36,US,California,Pinot Noir,"Intense and nervy, this has high acidity that gives it a mouthwatering quality. It's absolutely dry, with bright cherry-pie and spice flavors. Shows real promise for Marin County Pinot Noir."
82151,Fleur Du Cap,Bergkelder Selection,87,12,South Africa,Western Cape,Cabernet Sauvignon,"This Cab has all of the classic notes one would expect: rich dark berry fruit, black plum skin, cigar tobacco and black currant leaf are all front and center. The tannins are surprisingly firm and tightly structured, but the nuances of milk chocolate sauce and graham cracker crumb add decadence to the finish."
82720,Lava Cap,Estate Bottled,86,16,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,"Lava Cap Sauvignon Blanc is made from estate-grown grapes, then barrel ferments for a tropical, nutty, round version of the wine, with lots of creamy, tropical flavors. The finish shows off the wine's time in oak."
87259,Ktima Driopi,NA,85,25,Greece,Nemea,Agiorgitiko,"This earthy red starts with aromas of leather, cherry and dried fruit, followed by spicy pepper, leather and a touch of barnyard on the palate. Unfolding and interesting, the wine will open up with food—think red meat, game."
89660,McCrea,Boushey Vineyard Sirocco Blanc,95,25,US,Washington,White Blend,"Among McCrea's Rhône-inspired white wines, this is the most complete and complex. It's rich and dense, with honeycomb, lychee, lemon rind, pineapple and lots of stone—lovely and lingering. It seems to gain strength as it rolls through a sensational finish."
89996,Modus Operandi,NA,93,33,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,"A beautiful, complex and compelling wine that shows how well Napa can perform at Sauvignon Blanc, if it really wants to. It moves to the front ranks for its dryness, crispness and elegance, while delivering plenty of delicious flavor. Pineapples, lemons and limes flood the mouth, without the slightest grassy unripeness, and with a tantalizing hint of flowers and minerals. Totally elegant and sophisticated, a great white wine for the finest fare."
92602,Yonna,NA,81,25,Spain,Northern Spain,Red Blend,"Hot and poorly structured, with o.k. cherry cola aromas but very little on the palate. Tastes tart and of sour plums, with a short, starchy, tannic finish. Raw stuff that's not that good in the scheme of things."
93807,Santa Carolina,Reserva de Familia,83,20,Chile,Casablanca Valley,Chardonnay,Not much in the way of aromas except for flatness and apple juice. This wine is a cipher for the most part; it has flat apple and lemon flavors and then a maderized finish that is wheaty and suggests vanilla. Not fully vital; could already be past its prime.
94523,Lynmar,Five Sisters,97,100,US,California,Pinot Noir,"This important Pinot Noir is expensive, but it is absolutely worth a search. It's not a single-vineyard wine, but a blend of various blocks from the cooler southern part of the valley. Oak, to the tune of 70% new, is very strong in char and vanilla, but way stronger is the fruit itself, which is exemplary and stunning. Raspberries, cherries and strawberries just begin to describe it, with all sorts of spice and earth complexities. Stuns with purity, complexity and sheer delicious power. Great now, and will easily develop over the next 6–8 years."
94882,Saintsbury,NA,86,35,US,California,Pinot Noir,"A good, solid, everyday Pinot. Likeable for its dryness, crispness and silky texture. Shows adequate flavors of cherries, herbs, cedar and spices. Drink now."
99269,B Cellars,Georges III,93,55,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,"A classic example of a young, sweetly fruity and very refined Napa Cab that needs some time in the cellar. Polished and lovely, with finely ripe tannins and decadently good flavors of blackberries, black cherries, chocolate, currants and oak. The palate's enjoyment is interfered with by the astringency. Give it until 2012 to begin to come around."
99469,Millton,Riverpoint Vineyard,88,16,New Zealand,Gisborne,Chardonnay,"This wine offers easy drinkability at a fair price. It starts off with apple and melon scents, then folds in subtle toast and vanilla shadings, while the flavors of white peach and citrus make it versatile with food. Drink now and over the next couple of years."
99518,Edna Valley Vineyard,Islay Peak,86,25,US,California,Rhône-style Red Blend,"A Rhône blend from the cool Central Coast, this dry wine shows peppery flavors of blackberries, rhubarb and toast. The acids and tannins give it balance, and suggest rich fare, such as game and hard cheeses."
102797,Solaire by Robert Mondavi,NA,84,15,US,California,Chardonnay,"With its pear, apple, pineapple and oaky flavors, this Chard shows a good balance of crisp, cool-climate acidity. It's a little raw on the finish."
105874,Midnight,Synnove,84,22,US,California,Petite Verdot,"Raisins and chocolate are the dominant themes of this rather sweet, tannic wine. It's very full-bodied and soft in acidity, and it finishes a bit hot."
109929,Landmark,Damaris Reserve,84,38,US,California,Chardonnay,"New oak seems to dominate this Chard, swamping the actual flavor of the wine. The grapes provide lovely apricots and pineapples, balanced with fine acidity, but the oak swamps with smoke and vanilla and sappy wood cream."
110599,Stevens,424 Red Wine,91,32,US,Washington,Red Blend,"Beautiful aromas of fruit and fresh-baked bread rise from the glass. The wine shows good concentration, a mix of black cherry, blackberry, plum, and licorice; it's nicely proportioned and balanced, with the tannins big and polished."
110611,Acacia,Beckstoffer Las Amigas Vineyard,90,60,US,California,Pinot Noir,"From the Napa side of the appellation comes this dry, young Pinot Noir. The acids, tannins and new oak show now, and also the intensely ripe cherry fruit, with all the parts jockeying for position. Needs time to knit together. Best after 2007, and through 2011 before it loses fruit."
111450,Trentadue,La Storia Cuvée 32 Red Wine,88,32,US,California,Red Blend,"This is the best of the winery's current red releases. A blend of Sangiovese, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, it's ripely sweet in blackberry pie filling and mocha flavors, and while it's soft in acids, the tannins are pretty and polished. Try with grilled steak and a rich, wine-infused mushroom sauce."
112566,Skouras,Saint George-Cabernet Sauvignon,85,8,Greece,Peloponnese,Agiorgitiko,"A Beaujolais-like nose of raspberry and clay leads to a fruity wine with blueberry and raspberry and a streak of minerality. Only 5% Cabernet, it has a medium-full body supported by good tannins, finishing with tart red fruit."
113656,Resalte,Reserva,88,70,Spain,Northern Spain,Tempranillo,"Leather, tobacco, citrus peel and herbs make for a controlled bouquet that doesn't smack you in the face. The body, however, is tannic and grabby, while the flavors of sweet berry carry a roasted angle and a dash of spice. Chocolaty and spicy on the finish, but again it goes down hard and tannic, which is a drawback."
113911,Delas Freres,Marquise de la Tourette,89,54,France,Rhone Valley,Rhône-style White Blend,"Exotic fruits dominate this rich, ripe wine. To taste, there is an array of lychees, mangoes, nectarines, all giving richness and almost sweetness to the palate. It's already ready to drink, and should mature quickly."
115082,Las Moras,Black Label,86,18,Argentina,Other,Bonarda,"Black Label is a step up the quality ladder for Las Moras, based in San Juan. And this wine is full and chunky on the nose, with blackberry and plum-based aromas. In the mouth, it's more racy and oaky, teetering on sharp. But the freshness it boasts bodes well for pairing with meat, and the aforementioned oak lends a hint of cappuccino to an otherwise snappy finish."
116301,Concannon,Selected Vineyards,83,10,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Tough, with sweet and sour flavors of cherries and currants. Fruit forwardness characterizes this rustic young wine."
118104,V. Sattui,Quaglia Vineyard,87,33,US,California,Zinfandel,"You can taste the warm sunshine in the spicy berry flavors of this Zin. It comes right up to the edge of overripe, with suggestions of bitter raisins, then pulls back to let the cassis and cherry liqueur shine through."
119867,Tamaya,NA,87,10,Chile,Limari Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Tamaya seems to have turned the corner with its 2008 Cabs (the reserva is also very good). This wine is condensed and concentrated, with blackberry jam and other sweet berry aromas. The palate is pure and tastes of cassis and black fruit, while the finish has cola notes and a slight tannic bite. Generous for the price. Imported by Ecovalley Quality Wine Group and National Refrescos Import Company, LLC."
121465,Tenuta San Giorgio,Cacciacone,91,40,Italy,Tuscany,Red Blend,"Here's a fabulous 50-50 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah that offers black, thick consistency and meaty aromas of cured beef, peppercorn, smoke, tobacco and loads of luscious dark berry fruit. It's a soft, velvety wine with a plush, soft finish."
122787,Giacomo Grimaldi,Le Coste,95,75,Italy,Piedmont,Nebbiolo,"Founded in 1930 by Ferruccio Grimaldi, this family-run estate is now showing some very exciting results. The La Coste Barolo is a tight and focused wine that promises to age beautifully over many more years. The tannins and acidity are perfectly integrated and the nose boasts bright and intense layers of forest fruit, exotic spice, mesquite and black licorice."
122958,Puydeval,NA,87,14,France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Red Blend,"A lovely blend from the Languedoc comprised of 60% Cabernet Franc, 30% Syrah and 10% Merlot. The nose and mouth offers loads of menthol and garrigue herbs (especially lavender) along side bright small red berries and sweet green pepper. Medium weight and well structured with a lengthy finish."
123304,Vin du Lac,Barrel Select,87,40,US,Washington,Malbec,"Nice juice, tart and berry-flavored, with firm acidity and structure. Just a hint of plastic creeps into the finish."
124618,Adelaida,Viking Estate Vineyard Reserve,89,65,US,California,Syrah,"A dramatically dark, ripe wine that's nowhere near ready to drink now, due to the tannins. They're hard and strong and effectively shut the wine into astringent lockdown mode. But there's a solid core of blackberries, and the wine seems to have the balance to pass through this tannic sea into broader, softer oceans. Try after 2008."
124837,Pikes,The White Mullet Riesling-Viognier-Sauvignon Blanc-Chenin Blanc,88,15,Australia,South Australia,White Blend,"Mainly Riesling—and it shows in the wine's lime aromas and crushed-stone minerality. But the bits of pieces of other white grapes (Viognier, Sauvignon Blanc and Chenin Blanc) impart a bit more weight and fruity complexity, ending on a spicy note. Drink now."
126817,Nittnaus Anita und Hans,Sauvignon Blanc,87,16,Austria,Burgenland,Sauvignon Blanc,"The warm Burgenland climate has produced a Sauvignon Blanc that goes for the yellow fruits and richness. But there is also a good, crisp lemon streak that brightens the whole wine. For drinking this summer. Screwcap."
129563,Simonnet-Febvre,Fourchaume Premier Cru,91,35,France,Burgundy,Chardonnay,"Concentrated, dense, powerful and full of glistening green fruits, this wine is lightly touched with caramel, but more dominated by ripe acidity. The aftertaste is tight, suggesting good aging potential."
130348,J. Lohr,Late Harvest,90,25,US,California,White Riesling,"Sweet enough to be served as a dessert or with cheeses but not with dessert, this is a luscious, fruity wine that simply delicious. A hint of aprict adds dimension to the superripe apple and pineapple flavors."
131313,Trapiche,Broquel,88,15,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Cabernet Sauvignon,"This '05 Cab, shows berry aromas and some herbal essence, followed by flavors of boysenberry, blackberry, plum and coffee. It's well-oaked and solid, with tannic bite and good texture. A serious and real wine for a good price."
132728,Valley of the Moon,NA,88,16,US,California,Chardonnay,"Rich and full bodied, this is a tremendously ripe Chardonnay that explodes with peach custard, orange popsicle, pineapple, crème brûlée and cinnamon spice flavors, leading to a long, fruity finish."
137088,Wine Guerrilla,NA,82,30,US,California,Zinfandel,"Super-ripe and dry, with raisin and Port flavors wrapped into 16.5% alcohol. It's a good example of what it is, but certainly exceeds balance."
144117,Trapiche,Vina Jose Blanco,91,34,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Malbec,"Very big and brawny is this single-vineyard, new-to-the-market Malbec from grower Jose Blanco. Expect lots of fresh-cut cinnamon on the nose along with leather, earth and gum. Heavy but balanced, with big tannins wrapped in plenty of coconut and mint. Takes a while to grasp; it's a giant with huge fruit and some clumsiness. Better from 2007–2009. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd."
145455,Von Strasser,Post Vineyard,91,60,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Fairly tannic now, with a tart, dusty bite of grape skin, and also hefty in acidity. Underneath all that are ripe currant and cassis flavors. This is an age worthy wine that should develop great complexity after 2010."
149050,Wolf Blass,Barrel Fermented,86,12,Australia,South Australia,Chardonnay,"A bright pear and cinnamon nose opens this attractive, medium-weight wine. The palate shows peach and pear flavors, supported by brisk—some might say sharp—acidity, but flabby it isn't. Shows good balance and a nice long spicy finish, where the oak comes on strong."
149659,Chehalem,INOX,90,17,US,Oregon,Chardonnay,"Stainless steel fermented and aged, to bring bright, acid-driven fruit to the forefront. Full-bodied and flavorful, with nicely mixed stone fruits, pineapple, green berries and lemony citrus. It sets up sharply on the palate and holds true, just waiting for some fresh shellfish."
150046,Woodbridge,NA,82,8,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Inexpensive Cabernet can often be slightly weedy, even rubbery, with a hot feeling to it. So it is with this wine. The Mondavi folks managed to pack in as much blackberry and cassis fruit as they could, but there's really just a hint of it. The tannins are light, the acidity soft, and that's about it."
