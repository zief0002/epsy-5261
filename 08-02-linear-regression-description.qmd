## Case Study: College Completion Rates and ACT Scores

The ACT is designed to measure the skills that are acquired in secondary education that are most important for success in postsecondary education. If this is the case, we would expect that postsecondary institutions that admit students with higher ACT scores would have better outcomes. In other words:

> Are ACT scores predictive of better institutional outcomes?

To answer this question, we are going to examine the relationship between the 75th percentile ACT scores and the six-year completion rates for a sample of 92 postsecondary institutions in Minnesota and its adjacent states. To do this, we will be using the attributes `act` and `completion_rate` from the [midwest-college-scorecard.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zief0002/epsy-5261/main/data/midwest-college-scorecard.csv) dataset.

```{r}
#| message: false
library(educate)
library(ggformula)

library(mosaicCore)
library(tidyverse)


# Import data
colleges <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zief0002/epsy-5261/main/data/midwest-college-scorecard.csv")

# View data
colleges
```

### Data Exploration

As always, we will begin with an initial exploration of the sample data, in particular the distributions of the `act` and `completion_rate` attributes.

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Density plot of completion rates for the 92 institutions in the sample."
# Explore completion rates
gf_density(
  ~completion_rate, data = colleges,
  color = "black",
  fill = "#722F37",
  xlab = "Completion rate",
  ylab = "Density"
  )

df_stats(~completion_rate, data = colleges)
```

The distribution of completion rates for the 92 colleges in the sample is unimodal and symmetric, with a typical institution having a completion rate of around 0.62 (mean). There is a great deal of variation in completion rates, with institutional completion rates ranging from 0.23 to 0.91. Most institutions have a completion rate between 0.48 and 0.76 (SD = 0.14).


```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Density plot of ACT scores for the 92 colleges in the sample."
# Explore wine rating
gf_density(
  ~act, data = colleges,
  color = "black",
  fill = "#722F37",
  xlab = "75th percentil ACT score",
  ylab = "Density"
  )

df_stats(~act, data = colleges)
```

The sample distribution of 75th percentile ACT scores is right skewed, with a typical institution having a 75th percentile ACT score of 26 (median). There is variation in these scores, with institutions having 75th percentile ACT score between 20 and 35. The middle 50% of the institutions have 75th percentile ACT score between 24 and 28.

<br />


### Relationship Between Variables

To explore the relationship between ACT scores and completion rates we will create a scatterplot of these attributes. Because we ultimately want to predict institutions' completion rates based on their ACT scores, we will put completion rate (the outcome, or attribute we want to predict) on the *y*-axis and ACT score (predictor) on the *x*-axis. We will also compute the correlation coefficient between these attributes.


```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Scatterplot displaying the relationship between wine price and rating for the 90 wines in the sample."
gf_point(
  completion_rate ~ act, data = colleges,
  xlab = "75th percentile ACT score",
  ylab = "Completion rate"
  )

cor(completion_rate ~ act, data = colleges)
```

The plot visually shows the relationship (at least for these institutions) between 75th percentile ACT score and completion rate. When describing the relationship, remember, we want to touch on four characteristics of the relationship:

- Functional form of the relationship
- Direction/Trend
- Magnitude of the line, and
- Strength


The scatterplot suggests that there is a positive, linear relationship between 75th percentile ACT score and completion rate for the 92 institutions in our sample. This suggests that colleges that have higher 75th percentile ACT scores tend to also have higher completion rates. The magnitude of the relationship seems large as the slope of the relationship seems quite steep, indicating that even small changes in 75th percentle ACT score is associated with a big change in completion rates. This relationship seems pretty strong, with the data clustered pretty close to the line that describes this relationship ($r = 0.808$).

</br />


## Statistical Model: Mathematical Description of the Data

Since the relationship's functional form seems reasonably linear, we will use a *linear model* to describe the data. We can express this model mathematically as,

$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1(X) + \epsilon
$$

In this equation,

- $Y$ is the outcome/response value,
- $\beta_0$ is the intercept of the line that best fits the data,
- $\beta_1$ is the slope of the line that best fits the data,
- $X$ is the predictor value,
- $\epsilon$ is the error term (a.k.a. residual).


The regression model describes the relationship between *Y*-values and *X*-values in the *population*. Every term in the model denoted using a Greek letter is an unknown *parameter* in this model. In the model we have written there are three unknown parameters denoted in the model: the intercept term ($\beta_0$), the slope term ($\beta_1$), and the residual term ($\epsilon_i$).^[Technically there are many unknown residuals, one for each case, but the assumptions we put on the linear model make it so that we only care about the variance of the residuals, hence a single unknown.]

<br />


### Visual Representation of the Regression Model

To help better understand the model, consider the following plot:

```{r}
#| label: fig-visual-model
#| echo: false 
#| fig-cap: "Plot displaying conditional distribution of *Y* at several *X* values. The OLS fitted regression line (dotted) is also shown. The red points show the mean value of *Y* for each conditional distribution."
knitr::include_graphics("figs/conditional-means.png")
```

This plot shows that at each value of *X* there is a distribution of *Y*. These distributions are called *conditional distributions*. For example, there would be a conditional distribution of completion rates for the institutions with a 75th percentile ACT score of 20 (in the population). There would be another distribution of completion rates for the institutions with a 75th percentile ACT score of 21 (in the population). And so on. 

Each conditional distribution of *Y* has a mean; the conditional mean, which we denote as $\hat{Y}$. These conditional means can be connected using a line. This is what it means to be able to express the conditional mean of *Y* as a linear function of *X*, or to say that the relationship between *X* and *Y* is linear. 


<br />


### Two Components of the Statistical Model

The linear statistical model (i.e., the regression model) can be separated into two components: the *conditional mean* component and an *error* component.

$$
Y = \underbrace{\beta_0 + \beta_1(X)}_{\substack{\text{Conditional} \\ \text{Mean}}} + \underbrace{\epsilon}_{\substack{\text{Error}}}
$$


The first part of the equation gives the conditional mean value of *Y*, that is the mean value of *Y* for a particular *X*-value. The conditional mean of *Y* given a particular *X* value is denoted as $\hat{Y}$. We express the conditional mean mathematically as,

$$
\hat{Y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1(X)
$$



This part of the regression model is a description, in mathematical form, of how the conditional mean *Y* is related to *X*. The equation here indicates that the conditional mean of *Y* is a linear function of *X*. This implies that *the conditional mean value of Y* differs by a constant amount for a constant difference in *X*. 

For example, the difference between the mean completion rate for institutions that have a 75th percentile ACT score of 20 and those that have a 75th percentile ACT score of 21 *is the same as* the difference between the mean completion rate for institutions that have a 75th percentile ACT score of 30 and those that have a 75th percentile ACT score of 31. 

From the visual representation of the model, @fig-visual-model, we can see that there is a distribution of *Y*-values at each *X*-value; this is represented by the normal distributions in the picture. In our example, there are many institutions who have the same 75th percentile ACT score, but have different completion rates. The error term in the statistical model accounts for this variation in *Y* for those cases that have the same *X*-value. Mathematically we can understand this by re-writing the statistical model, substituting $\hat{Y}$ into the first part of the model.

$$
\begin{split}
Y &= \beta_0 + \beta_1(X) + \epsilon \\[2ex]
Y &= \hat{Y} + \epsilon
\end{split}
$$

This equation implies that each observed *Y*-value is the sum of the conditional mean value of *Y* (which is based on the *X*-value) and some *residual* (or error) term. 

To further understand the residual term, consider the plot below. This figure shows the relationship between 75th percentile ACT scores and completion rates we plotted earlier. It also includes the regression line.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| fig-cap: "Scatterplot displaying the relationship between 75th percentile ACT scores and completion rates. The OLS fitted regression line is also displayed. The blue point is the mean completion rate for colleges with a 75th percentile ACT score of 21."
rectangle = data.frame(
  act = c(20.5, 20.5, 21.5, 21.5),
  completion_rate = c(0.3, 0.55, 0.55, 0.3)
)

ggplot(data = colleges, aes(x = act, y = completion_rate) ) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  geom_point(x = 21, y = 0.42077, color = "blue", size = 4) +
  theme_bw() +
  #geom_rect(xmin = 20.5, xmax = 21.5, ymin = 0.3, ymax = 0.55, color = NULL) +
  geom_polygon(data = rectangle, fill = NA, color = "red") +
  xlab("75th percentile ACT score") +
  ylab("Completion rate")
```

Consider the three institutions that have a 75th percentile ACT score of 21. The conditional mean completion rate for these institutions is approximately 0.42. This is denoted by the blue point. (Remember, the conditional means are on the regression line.) The error (residual) term allows for a discrepancy between the conditional mean of *Y* and the observed *Y*. In other words, none of these three institutions have an actual completion rate of 0.42. The residual represents the difference between an institution's observed completion rate and the conditional mean completion rate.

Graphically, the residual is represented by the vertical distance between the line and a given point on the scatterplot. Some of those points are above the line (they have a positive residual) and some are below the line (they have a negative residual). Also note that for some observations the error term is smaller than for others.

## Estimating Parameters in the Regression Model


The terms $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ in the statistical model are referred to as the *regression parameters*. One of the primary goals of a regression analysis is to estimate the values of the regression parameters (i.e., the intercept and slope terms). 

In most statistical analyses, you will use a *sample* of data (not the entire population) to estimate the parameter values. Because a sample is only a subset of the population, the values we obtain for the parameters are imperfect estimates. To denote that the parameters are sample-based estimates, we denote estimates using Roman letters. For example, estimates of the parameters $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are obtained after fitting the model to data. For example the estimated conditional means can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\hat{Y} = b_0 + b_1(X)
$$

<br />


### Fitting a Regression Model to Data Using R

To fit the regression model to data using R, we will use the `lm()` function. The syntax for this function looks like this:

> `lm(`**outcome** ~ `1 + ` **predictor**, `data =` **dataframe**`)`

where **outcome** is the name of the outcome/response attribute, **predictor** is the name of the predictor attribute, and **dataframe** is the name of the data frame. (The `1` on the right side of the tilde tells R to include the intercept in its computation.) When we fit a regression model in R, we will also assign the output to a new object in R. Below, we fit the model using education level to predict income. Here the output is assigned to an object called `lm.a`. We can print the regression parameter estimates by typing the `lm()` object name and hitting enter.

```{r}
# Fit regression model
lm.a = lm(completion_rate ~ 1 + act, data = colleges)

# Print regression coefficients
lm.a
```

Here the parameter estimates (or regression coefficients) are:

- $b_0 = -0.36$
- $b_1 = .04$

Remember that these are estimates obtained from fitting the model to the sample data, and therefore we use the Roman letters to denote their values. Once we have the parameter estimates, we write the *fitted equation* which gives the mathematical description of the conditional means of *Y*. Based on our estimates, the fitted equation is:

$$
\hat{\mathrm{Completion~Rate}} = -0.36 + 0.04(\mathrm{ACT})
$$

<br />


### Intercept Interpretation

The estimate for the intercept was $-0.36$. Graphically, this value indicates the value where the line passes through the *Y*-axis (i.e., *Y*-intercept). As such, it gives the $\hat{Y}$ or predicted conditional mean value when $X=0$. Algebraically we get the same thing if we substitute 0 in for *X* in the fitted regression equation.

$$
\begin{split}
\hat{\mathrm{Completion~Rate}} &= -0.36 + 0.04(\mathrm{ACT}) \\[2ex]
&= -0.36 + 0.04(0) \\[2ex]
&= -0.36
\end{split}
$$

Interpreting the slope coefficient in our example,

> The intercept of $-0.36$ is the predicted mean completion rate for all institutions that have a 75th percentile ACT score of 0.

<br />


### Slope Interpretation

Recall from algebra that the slope of a line describes the change in *Y* versus the change in *X*. In regression, the slope describes the *predicted* change in $\hat{Y}$ for a one-unit difference in *X*. In our example,

$$
b_1 = \frac{\Delta\hat{Y}}{\Delta X} = \frac{0.04}{1}
$$


Again, because $\hat{Y}$ is a conditional mean, the slope represents the difference in predicted mean completion rates for each one-point difference in 75th percentile ACT score. Interpreting the slope coefficient in our example,

> Each one-point difference in 75th percentile ACT score is associated with a model predicted difference of 4 percentage points in mean completion rate.


To better understand this, consider colleges with different 75th percentile ACT scores. The first set of colleges have a 75th percentile ACT score of 20. The second set has a 75th percentile ACT score of 21, and the third set has aa 75th percentile ACT score of 22. Now let's compute the predicted mean completion rate for each of these institutions using our fitted equation.


$$
\begin{split}
\mathbf{ACT=20:~~} \hat{\mathrm{Completion~Rate}} &= -0.36 + 0.04(20) \\[2ex]
&= 0.44
\end{split}
$$



$$
\begin{split}
\mathbf{ACT=21:~~} \hat{\mathrm{Completion~Rate}} &= -0.36 + 0.04(21) \\[2ex]
&= 0.48
\end{split}
$$


$$
\begin{split}
\mathbf{ACT=22:~~} \hat{\mathrm{Completion~Rate}} &= -0.36 + 0.04(22) \\[2ex]
&= 0.52
\end{split}
$$

Each set of colleges have a 75th percentile ACT score differ by one point (20 to 21 to .04.

<br />


## Estimating Errors/Residuals

Note that we can also use the estimated regression coefficients to obtain estimates for the residuals, often referred to as the *observed residuals*. Here we make use of the earlier idea that the residual term was the difference between the observed value of *Y* and the conditional mean of *Y* for a given *X*-value. Mathematically, 

$$
\epsilon = Y - \hat{Y}
$$

Once we use data to obtain estimates for the intercept and slope ($b_0$ and $b_1$) we can substitute those into the fitted equation and obtain an estimate for the conditional mean ($\hat{Y}$). This value can then be used to obtain an estimate for the residual.

$$
e = Y - \hat{Y}
$$

Remember, the use of the roman letter "e" for the residual indicates it is an estimate based on values obtained from the data!

As an example, consider the data for the Marquette University.

```{r}
#| echo: false
colleges |>
  filter(row_number() == 71)
```

Marquette University has a 75th percentile ACT score of 30, and its observed completion rate is 0.814. 

Using the fitted regression equation, we can compute the predicted conditional mean completion rate for institutions with a 75th percentile ACT score of 30 as,

$$
\begin{split}
\hat{\mathrm{Completion~Rate}} &= -0.3642 + 0.0374(30) \\[2ex]
&= 0.757
\end{split}
$$


Now we can use the estimated conditional mean to also compute Marquette University's residual.

$$
\begin{split}
e &= \mathrm{Completion~Rate} - \hat{\mathrm{Completion~Rate}}\\[2ex]
&= 0.814 - 0.757 \\[2ex]
&= 0.057
\end{split}
$$

The positive residual suggests that Marquette University has a completion rate that is 0.057 higher than the average predicted completion rate for colleges with a 75th percentile ACT score of 30. We can also represent these values graphically.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| fig-cap: "Plot displaying the 75th ACT scores and completion rates along with the fitted regression line (blue). Marquette University's observed completion rate (pink dot) and the predicted mean for colleges with a 75th percentile ACT score of 30 (blue dot) are both plotted. A visual representation of Marquette University's residual (green line) is also displayed."

## Answering the Research Question

Remember that this whole analysis was driven because we wanted to answer a question, namely whether 75th percentile ACT scores are predictive of college completion rates. The results from the regression analysis allow us to answer this question.

> To answer the question of whether 75th percentile ACT scores are predictive of college completion rates, a linear regression model was fitted to the data. The results of this analysis suggested that 75th percentile ACT scores are positively related to completion rates for the 92 sample colleges ($b_1 = 0.037$). Each 1-point difference in 75th percentile ACT scores of education is associated with a 0.037-unit difference in completion rates, on average.


<!-- Here the regression analysis provides a quantitative summary of the relationship between 75th percentile ACT scores and completion rates. It provides us with information about the direction of the relationship (positive) and the magnitude of that relationship. Although this can give us a description of the relationship, it is only for the sample of data you looked at (i.e., for these 92 institutions). To make further statements about whether there is a relationship between e75th percentile ACT scores and completion rates in a broader population (e.g., all U.S. institutions of higher education), we need more information, namely (1) whether the sample is representative of the larger population, and also (2) statistical information about the amount of sampling error we have. -->
